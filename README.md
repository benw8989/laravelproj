# laravelproj
A basic MVC web design using Laravel
This project is far from complete but will be added to in the future as an ongoing project.
The base concept of the MVC is seen in app/Http/Controllers/ where the PagesController manages what view is sent to the user.
The views are found under resources/views where you can see the layout plus the pages.
